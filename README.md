# deep-learning-starter-guide
The guide for deep learning beginner, include Linux Basic, Math Basic, Deep-Learning Basic. and etc.

You should read these guides sequentially.

**For contributors, you can write your `.md` docs in Chinese or English, but `README.md` in English only**

## Linux Basic

[linux basic](linux-basic.md) This doc will introduce you some basic but useful knowledge of linux system. Skilled in Linux is very helpful to your deep-learning research and development.

## Math Basic

[math basic](math-basic.md) This doc will introduce you some important and frequently-used Matrix knowledge in deep-learning.

## Deep-Learning Basic

[machine learning basic](machine-learning-basic.md) This doc will introduce you some basic knowledge about machine learning such as `Cost Function` and etc.

[convolutional neural network](cnn-basic.md) This doc will give you **a global view of CNN** and tell you some technical terms widely used in CNN.The following recommended tutorial [UFLDL](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/LinearRegression/) is a detailed explain of each single part of CNN such as Pooling, Convolution and etc.

A good tutorial is [UFLDL](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/LinearRegression/). It's highly recommended to read this tutorial one by one sequentially.
